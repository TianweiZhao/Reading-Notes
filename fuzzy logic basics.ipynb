    "# Fuzzy logic - what is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic derived from fuzzy set theory, used to handle the concept of partial truth. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Unlike classical (Boolean) logic which only allows:\n",
    "    - True or False (1 or 0)\n",
    "* Fuzzy logic allows degrees of truth, meaning a statement can be partially true and partially false at the same time. \n",
    "    - For example, \"it is hot today\"  might be 0.7 true depending on temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use fuzzy logic?\n",
    "* Because many real-world concepts are not black and white - they are vague or imprecise (e.g., \"tall\", \"hot\", \"fast\"). Fuzzy logic allows machine to reason in a human-like way\n",

    "# How fuzzy is logic is widely used in modern control systems, especially in industrial settings where processes are complex, nonlinear, or imprecise? \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use fuzzy logic in control systems?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. No precise mathematical model required\n",
    "Fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) don't need an exact model of the system - they can work with linguistic rules like:\n",
    "\"If temperature is high and pressure is low, then decrease flow rate slightly\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Handle uncertainty and imprecision\n",
    "Many industrial environments involve noisy sensors, dead time, or fuzzy human descriptions. Fuzzy logic thrives in this gray area.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Easy to interpret and modify\n",
    "Operators can understand and adjust the rules based on experience.\n",

    "## Real-World Industiral Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Chemical Process Control (e.g., reactors, distillation columns)\n",
    "    * Process variables like temperature, pH, or concentration are often nonlinear and interact\n",
    "    * Fuzzy logic can adjust PID parameters or make setpoint decisions in real time\n",
    "2. Fuzzy PID Tuning (Adaptive Control)\n",
    "    * FLCs dynamically adjust PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) based on fuzzy rules\n",
    "        - If error is large and increasing fast -> increase Kp\n",
    "3. HVAC Systems\n",
    "    * Fuzzy controllers regulate room temperature based on user preferences, humidity, and outside conditions — better comfort than bang-bang or basic PID.\n",
    "4. Robotics and Motion Control\n",
    "    * Fuzzy logic is used in mobile robots for: Obstacle avoidance; Path planning; Motor speed control\n",
    "5. Power Systems and Smart Grids\n",
    "    * Load forecasting, reactive power control, frequency regulation — fuzzy logic is used to integrate human-like reasoning into grid stability decisions.\n",
    "6. Manufacturing (CNC, Welding)\n",
    "    * Surface roughness control in machining; Adaptive welding process regulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're controlling the cooling rate of an exothermic reactor.\n",

    "* Inputs: Temperature deviation (error), change in temperature (delta error)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - IF error is high AND delta error is positive → THEN increase coolant flow significantly\n",
