    "1. Process Interactions & Loop Coupling\n",
    "   * Issue: Many chemical processes involve **highly coupled variables** (e.g., temperature and pressure in distillation columns). Changes in one loop often affect other loops, making tuning difficult.\n",
    "   * Example: In a heat exchanger network, adjusting flow rate to control temperature may impact downstream processes.\n",
    "   * Impact: Causes loop interactions, instability, and oscillations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Difficulty in Tuning Multiple Loops\n",
    "   * Issue: PID tuning for a single loop is straightforward, but when multiple loops interact, **adjusting one loop may destablize another**.\n",
    "   * Example: Ziegler-Nichols tuning works well for single loops but often fails in multi-loop systems due to interactions.\n",
    "   * Impact: Manual tuning becomes an iterative process, **requiring expert knowledge**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Process Nonlinearities:\n",
    "   * Issue: Many chemical processes exhibit **nonlinear behavior**, meaning PID control designed for one operating point may perform poorly at different conditions.\n",
    "   * Example: pH control in a neutralization process is highly nonlinear, requiring adaptive strategies.\n",
    "   * Impact: Traditional PID control struggles with **varying setpoints, disturbances, and large operating ranges**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Time Delays (Dead Time):\n",
    "   * Issue: Many chemical processes, such as distillation and heat exchangers, have significant **time delays due to transport phenomena**.\n",
    "   * Example: In a distillation column, it may take minutes for a reflux ratio adjustment to affect the product composition.\n",
    "   * Impact: PID controllers cannot handle long dead times well, **leading to sluggish or oscillatory responses**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Lack of Robustness to Process Changes:\n",
    "   * Issue: Chemical plants operate under **changing conditions** due to variations in feed composition, equipment aging, or external disturbances.\n",
    "   * Example: A chemical reactor's dynamics change as catalyst deactivates over time.\n",
    "   * Impact: Fixed PID settings may become ineffective, **requiring frequent re-tuning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Poor Handling of Constraints:\n",
    "   * Issue: PID controllers **do not inherently handle actuator saturation or process constraints**.\n",
    "   * Example: A valve reaching 100% open position can cause windup, leading to sluggish recovery.\n",
    "   * Impact: Requires **anti-windup mechanisms**, but these are not always effective in multi-loop control.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Limited Predictive Capability:\n",
    "   * Issue: PID controllers react only to past and present errors, with **no ability to anticipate future disturbances**.\n",
    "   * Example: Model Predictive Control (MPC) outperforms PID in systems with slow dynamics and constraints.\n",
    "   * Impact: PID is **less effective in dynamic, multivariable, and constrained processes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Lack of Integration with Advanced Control Strategies:\n",
    "   * Issue: Many industrial PID controllers run **independently** without integration into Advanced Process Control (APC) frameworks.\n",
    "   * Example: A PID loop for a reactor temperature may not be coordinated with feed flowrate adjustments in an upstream process.\n",
    "   * Impact: Leads to **suboptimal control performance** across the plant."
